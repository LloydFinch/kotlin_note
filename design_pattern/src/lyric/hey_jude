hey jude, don't make it bad
take a sad song and make it better
remember to let her into your heart
then you can start to make it better

hey jude, don't be afraid
you were made to go out and get her
the minute you let her under your skin
then you begin to make it better

and anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain
don't carry the world upon your shoulders
for will you know, that is a fool, who plays it cool
by making his world, a litter colder
na na na na na_  na na na na

hey jude, don't let me down
you have found her, now go and get her
remember to let her into your heart
then you can start to make it better

so let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin
you are waiting for someone to perform with
and don't you know that is just you, hey jude, you'll do
the movement you need is on your shoulder
na na na na na_  na na na na

hey jude, don't make it bad
take a sad song and make it better
remember to let her under your skin
then you'll begin to make it better, better(repeat..six times)
na__ na na_   na na na_   na na na_, hey jude(repeat)...
