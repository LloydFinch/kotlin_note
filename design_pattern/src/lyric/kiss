you don't have to be beautiful
to turn me on
I just need your body baby
form dusk till dawn
you don't need experience
to turn me out
you just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

*
you don't have to be rich
to be my girl
you don't have to be cool
to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign
I'm more compatible with
I just need your extra time and kiss

you got no talk dirty baby
if you want to impress me
you can't be too flirty mama
I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy
maybe you could be mine
you just leave it all up to me
we could have a good time
[* again]

I think I wanna dance
(
I wanna dance for
to be my girl
to rule my world
kiss,kiss,kiss
)
(little girl wendy's parade)
women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
act your age mama
not your shoe size
maybe we could do the twirl
you don't have to watch dynasty
to have an attitude
you just leave it all up to me
my love will be your food
