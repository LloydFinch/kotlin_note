there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch, it's bring me out of the dark
finally I can see you crystal clear
go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
see how I leave with every piece of you
don't underestimate the things that I will do
there's a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out of the dark

*
the scars of your love remind me of us they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love they leave me breathless
i can't help felling
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
and you play it, to the beat
*

baby I have no story to be told
but I've heard one oon you and I'm gonna make your head burn
think of me in the depths of your despair
make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
* again
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
but you play it with a beating

throw your soul through every open door
count your blessings to find what you look for
turn my sorrow into treasured gold
you'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you saw
we could have had it all
we could have had it all
it all
it all
it all
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
and you play it to the beat
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
but you played it
you played it
you played it
you played it
to the beat
